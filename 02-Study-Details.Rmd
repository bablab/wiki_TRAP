# Study Details

## Task 

**TRAP Task Overview**
![<!--- Task --->](images/trap_task_overview.png)
- Participants continuously (sampled at 5 Hz) report their subjective experience of arousal throughout the task.
- The rating of arousal does not have bounds: it can increase or decrease without limit. Therefore, all responses should be considered relative within a participant.

**Videos**
- Videos were previously normed in another study (Schaefer et al., 2010)

**Signals:**

- ECG
- EDA

## TRAP 2.0

- To replicate findings from the initial TRAP analyses, a second dataset (TRAP 2.0) was collected. The procedure was largely the same with some minor adjustments or improvements:
  - The task was programed in Psychopy to improve quality from Matlab Version
  - The first Video (V1a and V1b) was replace by a clip from The Piano (still Negative Valence, High Arousal)
  - The second video (V2) was replaced with a clip from Dead Poets Society (Postive Valence, High Arousal) to attempt to distinguish arousal effects from valence effects.
  - In addition to ECG, EDA, and Respiration, Impedance Cardiography (ICG) was also collected during the task using a 4 spot electrode configuration (top of sternum, ziphoid, lower neck, lower back).
  - The ASI-3 was not administered in TRAP 2.0
  - However, the CTQ (short version from SoM), Interoceptive Confusion Questionnaire (ICQ), and State Trait Anxiety Inventory - Trait (STAI-T) were all added
