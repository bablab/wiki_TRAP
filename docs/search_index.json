They will then watch videos that are intended to evoke affective and physiological responses, while we collect continuous measures of subjective and physiological arousal. We plan to measure the temporal concordance between the subjective and objective arousal. We will then test the relationship between temporal concordance and individual difference measures related to psychological well-being. We also plan to test if predictability of stimuli alters the temporal concordance of arousal. 2.2 Aims Specific Aim 1: Establish if differences in temporal concordance between subjective and objective arousal associated with individual differences in psychological well-being. Specific Aim 2: Establish if differences in temporal concordance between subjective and objective arousal associated with individual differences in early life experience. Specific Aim 3: Test if predictability alters the temporal concordance between subjective and objective arousal. 2.3 Background To maximize efficiency, the brain anticipates the needs of the body and prepares to meet them before they arise. The brain must accurately and efficiently perceive, integrate, and represent afferent information about the body to do this, a process known as interoception. Dimensions of interception have been associated with well-being and our experience of arousal. In this current study, we plan to investigate the temporal relationship between continuous subjective and objective measures of physiological arousal, a relationship that likely involves interoceptive processes. We will test if this proxy-measure of interoception is related to individual differences in psychological well-being and early life experiences. Additionally, we plan to test the hypothesis that environmental predictability will be associated with the temporal concordance of subjective and objective arousal. This work with further our understanding of how interoceptive efficiency may be a critical mechanism to overall well-being, as well as how it contributes to our everyday experience of arousal.

Therefore, all responses should be considered relative within a participant.

The procedure was largely the same with some minor adjustments or improvements: - The task was programed in Psychopy to improve quality from Matlab Version - The first Video (V1a and V1b) was replace by a clip from The Piano (still Negative Valence, High Arousal) - The second video (V2) was replaced with a clip from Dead Poets Society (Postive Valence, High Arousal) to attempt to distinguish arousal effects from valence effects. - In addition to ECG, EDA, and Respiration, Impedance Cardiography (ICG) was also collected during the task using a 4 spot electrode configuration (top of sternum, ziphoid, lower neck, lower back). - The ASI-3 was not administered in TRAP 2.0 - However, the CTQ (short version from SoM), Interoceptive Confusion Questionnaire (ICQ), and State Trait Anxiety Inventory - Trait (STAI-T) were all added "],["running-sessions.html", "Section 4 Running Sessions 4.1 Pre-Session 4.2 During Session 4.3 Post-Session", " Section 4 Running Sessions 4.1 Pre-Session Recruitment All recruitment is conducted through SONA Scheduling Slots are scheduled through SONA Each slot is 1 hour Schedule at least 30 mins (Preferably 1 hour) between slots Make sure Slot is marked on “Bear Den” Calendar Once a slot is filled, send Scheduling Email (see email templates on Box) For slot filled &gt;1 week in advance, send reminder email 24-48hrs prior to session 4.2 During Session Preparation Arrive at least 15 minutes prior to the scheduled session start time.

Then we will attach some sensors to your torso and hand, that allow us to measure how your body reacts during the study. You will then watch some videos and rate how you are feeling throughout. The session can last up to 1 hour.” Allow the participant to read through the consent form Check if/answer any questions the participant might have Have you and the participant sign and date both copies of the consent form Keep one copy for our records; Have them take one copy for theirs Questionnaires Open the REDCap Questionnaires on the iPad Hand the participant the iPad and ask them to complete the questionnaires You can let them know: Each questionnaire will automatically proceed to the next If they have any questions, they can ask you for clarification It should take approximately 15 minutes When the participant has completed the questionnaires, they will return the iPad to you. Physiological Hook-up Ask the participant if they need to use the rest room Collect Height and Weight measurements (enter into REDCap). Ask the participant if they have any skin allergies or sensitives Summarize/explain the physiology procedure to the participant i.e., “Ok, so now I am going to place some sensors on your body. The sensors will stick to your skin but can be easily peeled off. I will place one sensor on your right collarbone, two on your lower rib cages, and two on the palm of your non-dominant hand. Before place each sensory, I will clean the area with an alcohol wipe and some gauze. We will also place a respiration belt around torso. I will walk you through everything as we go, but if you have any questions or anything feels uncomfortable, don’t hesitate to let me know.” Place ECG Electrodes: Find where you will place sensor Clean the area with the alcohol wipe and then gauze Apply a small dot of electrode gel to the sensor Stick the sensor to the skin Repeat for all 3 spots Place Respiration belt: It should fit semi-tightly around the torso, just above rib-ECG electrodes, but below sternum. Plastic piece in front and centered. It should NOT be uncomfortably tight Remember when the participant sits, the belt will likely become slightly tighter Have Participant sit in chair (in front of stimulus computer). Place EDA electrodes Apply 0.2 mL of isotonic paste to each EDA electrode Do NOT clean hand with alcohol Place the two electrodes with paste on the palm of the participant’s non-dominant hand Do not press on the center when placing – this will cause paste to squeeze out Attached leads to electrodes ECG &amp; Respiration attach to same transmitter EDA has its own transmitter (attaches to wrist) Check Signals in Acqknowledge TRAP Task Open Matlab Make sure you are in the correct folder /Users/brainandbodylabmacmini2/Desktop/TRAP_Task In the Console Window type: TRAP_Task(‘trap_XXX’) i.e., Participant 1 would be ‘trap_001’ Press Enter Walk participant through instructions Make sure participant has headphones on Rest of task will proceed automatically During the task monitor both the physiology and participant Make notes throughout: i.e., Physio signal looked weird, participant talked/laughed, etc. Try to note times as well to make it easier to examine post-hoc After Task is Complete, ask Video Familiarity Questions Matlab Troubleshooting: Close task: Ctr + C -&gt; sca -&gt; Enter Move up a directory: cd ..
